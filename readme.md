# Skill Swap Hub

This project is a simple front-end Web Page for a “Skill Swap Hub” platform. The goal was to create a basic website where users can browse hobbies, view resources, create a profile, and share useful links. I used a Bootstrap template and adapted it to match the requirements from the brief.

## Project Overview

The website includes:
- Home page with search bar, category filter, and list of resources
- Individual hobby pages (Coding, Baking, Art, AI Tools)
- Login and Register pages
- User Profile page with the required fields
- About Us and Contact pages
- A form for adding new resources
- Basic visual like and comment features under posts

Most of the required features from the brief are included. Any missing functionality (like real authentication or saving comments) is because this is a front-end only MVP.

## Technical Choices

- **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5** for layout and styling  
- **I used a simple bootstrap theme called clean blog which I edited myself to meet the brief's criteria**
- **Font Awesome** for icons  
- **Small amount of JavaScript** (Bootstrap scripts)  
- I chose Bootstrap because it made the layout easier and helped keep the design consistent without writing too much custom CSS.

## Missing Features (Justification)

- No real backend or database (not required by brief)
- Login/Register are visual only
- Comments and likes are not stored anywhere
- Search and filter are UI elements only

These limitations are acceptable for a MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT, and the brief allows simplified functionality.

## Timeline and Milestones

- Week 1: Planning and reading the brief, Setting up the main pages and navigation  
- Week 2: Login, Register, Profile pages, Hobby pages and resource posts
- Week 3: Adding comments, likes, and resource form
- Week 4: Final adjustments, testing, and preparing submission 


## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- No real user data is collected  
- Images used are either free-to-use or created by me  
- The project does not store personal information  
- Basic accessibility is supported through Bootstrap  

## Version Control

I did not use GitHub to store the project files but uploaded on GitHub for the final version. The repository contains all the files needed to run the project.
